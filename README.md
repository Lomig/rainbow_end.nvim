# rainbow_end.nvim

Highlight Ruby datastructure with a rainbow of colors!

## Original project

This was "forked" from this very old project: https://github.com/vim-scripts/rainbow-end

Unfortunately, it was written in Ruby, and thus unable to work anymore with Neovim.
This version is written in lua.
